2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Nanoprocessor_4bit_0/PC_3bit_0/D_FF_2/Load_Sel_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) Nanoprocessor_4bit_0/Ins_Decoder_0/Load_Sel_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
